# NPM Dependency Management Implementation

## Task: NPM-Focused Dependency Management
- [x] Find all npm-related files
- [x] Check for npm lock files
- [x] Install dependencies using npm
- [x] Verify successful npm installation

## Detailed Implementation Steps:

### Phase 1: NPM File Discovery
- [x] 1.1 Scan project structure for package.json files
- [x] 1.2 Identify npm-specific configuration files
- [x] 1.3 Check for .npmrc and npm-related configs
- [x] 1.4 Map npm workspace structure

### Phase 2: NPM Lock File Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Locate existing npm lock files (package-lock.json)
- [x] 2.2 Check for npm-shrinkwrap.json
- [x] 2.3 Analyze lock file status and sync state
- [x] 2.4 Identify any lock file conflicts

### Phase 3: NPM Installation Process
- [x] 3.1 Clean existing node_modules (if needed)
- [x] 3.2 Install dependencies using npm install
- [x] 3.3 Handle npm-specific issues and resolutions
- [x] 3.4 Update lock files as needed

### Phase 4: NPM Installation Verification
- [x] 4.1 Verify all declared dependencies are installed
- [x] 4.2 Check npm audit for security issues
- [x] 4.3 Test npm scripts functionality
- [x] 4.4 Validate package.json integrity

## Expected Deliverables:
1. Complete npm file inventory
2. NPM lock file analysis report
3. Successful npm installation confirmation
4. NPM dependency verification results
