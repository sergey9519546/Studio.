### I. THE MANIFESTO (VISUAL PHYSICS)

We are not building a tool; we are engineering a state of flow. The interface must feel weightless.

**1. THE CANVAS (Luminance):**

* **Global Background:** `bg-[#F5F5F7]` (System Mist). The infinite void.
* **The Object:** `bg-[#FFFFFF]` (Porcelain). Cards sit *on* the mist.
* **The Contrast:** Text is NEVER #000000. Use `#1D1D1F` (Obsidian) for primary data, `#86868B` (Slate) for metadata.

**2. THE MATERIAL (Liquid Glass):**

* Sidebars and Floating Headers must use: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)`.
* Background fill: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)`.
* Borders are forbidden. Use separation via luminance and spacing.

**3. THE GEOMETRY:**

* **Radii:** All corners are `rounded-[24px]` (Squircles). Geometric rounding is primitive.
* **Shadows:** Ambient Levitation only. `box-shadow: 0px 10px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)`.

---

### II. THE ARCHITECTURE (TECH STACK)

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + React.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Strict config based on the Manifesto).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (with pgvector for AI memory).
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini Vision (Multimodal Analysis) + Vertex AI Embeddings.
* **State:** Tanstack Query.

### III. THE APPLICATION MODULES (FUNCTIONAL SPECS)

#### 1. THE FREELANCER ROSTER (The Talent)

Create a directory that feels like a casting agency lookup.

* **Data:** Name, Role, Availability Status (Boolean), Rate, Skills (Tags).
* **AI Feature:** "Talent Matching." The AI scans project briefs and suggests freelancers from this roster based on their skill tags.

#### 2. THE PROJECT HUB (The List)

A clean, Apple-style list view of active creative projects.

* **The "Ingest" Engine:**
  * Build a drag-and-drop zone that accepts `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, and Google Sheet URLs.
  * **AI Action:** Upon upload, the AI must parse these documents, extract the Project Name, Client, Deliverables, and Tone, and auto-populate the database.

#### 3. THE PROJECT DASHBOARD (The Core)

When a project is clicked, enter the "Project Space." This is a grid-based layout:

* **Top Left (The Brief):** Editable text area for the creative brief.
* **Mid Left (The Vibe):** Two sections: "Mood/Tone Tags" and "Do's & Don'ts."
* **Bottom Left (Asset Library):** A grid of uploaded images/videos.
  * **AI Vision:** When an image is uploaded, Google Gemini Vision must analyze it and generate hidden metadata tags (e.g., "Cinematic," "Blue hour," "Minimalist") to feed the Project Intelligence.
* **Top Right (Metadata):** Deliverables specs (Resolution, Aspect Ratio, Duration).
* **Bottom Right (The Script Window):** Upload/View shotlists. Direct link to the "Writer's Room."

#### 4. THE WRITER'S ROOM (The Brain)

This is a dedicated view for high-end AI generation.

* **The RAG System (Project Intelligence):** This is the killer feature.
  * The AI context window must be pre-loaded with: The Creative Brief + Analyzed Asset Tags + Do's/Don'ts + "Project Intelligence" Articles (URLs uploaded by user).
* **Function:** A chat/editor interface where the user says "Draft a 30-second commercial script," and the AI generates it *specifically* citing the uploaded assets and adhering to the "Do's & Don'ts."

#### 5. THE MOODBOARD (The Eye)

A Pinterest-style masonry grid.

* **AI Tagging:** Every image uploaded is auto-tagged by AI.
* **Semantic Search:** User searches "Melancholy summer," and the AI retrieves images based on visual analysis, not just filename.

### IV. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

1. **Setup:** Initialize Next.js with the "Liquid Glass" Tailwind config.
2. **Schema:** Define the PostgreSQL schema (Projects, Assets, Freelancers, Embeddings).
3. **UI Construction:** Build the "Project Dashboard" first, ensuring the optical alignment is perfect.
4. **AI Integration:** Connect Google AI APIs for the "Ingest Engine" (Document Parsing) and "Writer's Room" (Contextual Generation).

**EXECUTE.**
